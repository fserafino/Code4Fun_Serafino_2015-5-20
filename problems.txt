following rules:
	 each message will consist of only lowercase characters a-z and space characters
	 to insert two characters in sequence from the same key, the user must pause before
pressing the key a second time

	 hi is encoded as 44_444
	 yes is encoded as 999337777
	 foo bar (two spaces) is encoded as 333666_6660_022_2777
